{Major Loss} - 
Narrator: You lost.
Maeve: “I find your performance to be unsatisfactory.”
Maeve: “You won’t be able to protect yourself, and we won’t waste resources protecting you.”
Maeve: “It’s time to leave. Connor, escort our guest out.”
Narrator: Connor pulls you up off the ground and opens a portal under your feet before anyone has time to protest.
Narrator: You fall feet first onto your bed, ouch. 
Narrator: At least the bed is comfortable, time to sleep off the bruises.

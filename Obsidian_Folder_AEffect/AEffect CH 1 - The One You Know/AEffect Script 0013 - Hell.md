At the end quote displayed: “When someone leaves your life, those exits are not made equal. Some are beautiful and poetic and satisfying. Others are abrupt and unfair. But most are just unremarkable, unintentional, clumsy.” - Griffin McElroy

[You gained the item {Father’s Note 2/2}]
{Father’s Note 2/2} - Item, Description: “A note signed by your late father reading: [You can’t have your cake and eat it too, Abel. Make a decision or I will make it for you. You have always been a sensitive boy, but your mind is in the right place. Please Abel, think of your brother. Signed, Markus Solis] The note is ripped at the top, this seems to be the end half of a letter to Abel.” [Game Note: This item has no significance until you get the first half of the letter, where Markus is threatening to gain custody of Sora and use him for experiments. Author’s Note: Markus sucks.]
[Author’s Note about End 2: In this end, Abel is found to have been betraying the Council and is killed by Connor.]

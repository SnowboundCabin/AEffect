Narrator: The two of you are alone.
Maeve: I am a member of a government organization that goes by the title of Council of Logistical Controls.
Maeve: All of the information I'm about to tell you is classified and should be spoken of only on a need-to-know basis.
Maeve: I wouldn't be giving any of this information out had you not stumbled head-first into our conflict.
Sora: I get that this is top secret info, can I hear details now?
Maeve: Yes.
Maeve: The CLC has sent two of it's officers, that would be Floris and I, to create a taskforce in order to achieve certain goals.
Maeve: As of now, we have three goals: Population control of other magical species that have been deemed as risks to the general public, gaining knowledge of the experiments that Dr. Solis left behind, and using his research and instructions to unlock a vault with items crucial to the survival of our taskforce and the CLC as a whole. 
Maeve: I would inform you of these critical items and what they do, however, I have not been granted access to this information.
Maeve: Each member of the team has a purpose.
Maeve: Our taskforce has three members you haven't met yet, but they should be arriving back to base soon. 
Maeve: Any questions?
Choice: {"What is your purpose?"} or {"What is each individuals purpose?"}

At the end quote displayed: “When someone leaves your life, those exits are not made equal. Some are beautiful and poetic and satisfying. Others are abrupt and unfair. But most are just unremarkable, unintentional, clumsy.” - Griffin McElroy

[You gained the item {Brother’s Note 1}]
{Brother’s Note 1} - Item, Description: “A note from Abel reading: [I’m leaving for a bit, but I’ll be back. Stay safe until I get back. Love, Abel] Holding this gives you hope.” [Game Note: This item is the only way to avoid a pure bad end when only Sora is left alive. In other route’s Sora won’t remember receiving the note, but can still interact with it.]

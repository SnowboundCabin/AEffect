[Author’s Note: Outside of story events, I would like for major characters to have 3-5 events per Chapter (Probably). If this gets to be too much then I can always cut it down.]
[Game Note for Menu Screen: I would like stats here with the summaries if we have them. I’m not sure if character favor should be listed in anything other than Hint Mode. I want the menu to be accessible almost all the time. Menu should also have a slot for items. Other characters shouldn’t be visible in the menu until they come into the story.]

CH 1 - The One You Know - Menu Character Summaries

Pre-Game - Intro [Pre-all choices]

Sora Belosa - 
It’s you. You want to get out of this suit, it’s depressing. 
~
[Author’s Note for Sora: As the chapters go on, depending on how Sora acts, I would like the summary to change. (Ex.: It’s you!! VS It’s you?)]

Abel Solis - 
Abel is your older twin brother. He’s older than you by 5 minutes, he acts like it was 5 years. You haven’t seen each other in 10 years. The two of you were separated by a custody battle of your parents divorce, and only met back up again for your father’s funeral. He’s still the same at the core.

CH 1 - The One You Know

Black screen with Sora/Abel text font and bleeps:
“I had never been a religious person, but I prayed and prayed to see you again, 
And somehow,
It worked.”

Narration: You stand before the mirror of your childhood room, grieving a father you barely knew. It’s making you reflect on all that’s happened. You change out of your black suit and into something a bit more comfortable as you continue to think.

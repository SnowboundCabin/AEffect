Narrator: Abel makes an exaggerated bow.
Lena: “[Abel?]”
Lena: “Dr. Solis’ son, Abel?”
Narrator: Lena scrambles to xir feet and runs over. 
Abel: “Yeah?”
Narrator: Abel sounds confused about Lena’s excitement. He clears his throat.
Abel: “I mean, yes. I’m Abel Solis and I’m here to help the council with loose ends on my father’s research.”
Lena: “[Cool!]”
Narrator: Billie cuts in before Lena can start talking again. 
Billie: “Very cool.”
Billie: “I have to take these two to see Maeve now.”
Narrator: Lena looks downtrodden.
Billie: “Ah! They’ll be back soon though. (Don’t worry, Lena.)”
Narrator: With that, Billie leads the party back through the winding halls.
Screen fades to black.
~ Time Skip ~
Screen fades back in.
Narrator: Billie takes you to a set of giant doors. It struggles to get the heavy doors apart. After a solid few seconds of trying, one of the doors swings open.
Narrator: Inside is a garden.
??? [Maeve]: “Nice of you three to join me.”
Narrator: The voice comes from the person in a green dress floating in the middle of the garden. 
??? [Maeve]: “I’m Maeve, my pronouns are she/her, and I am the overseer of this branch of CLC’s officers.”
Narrator: Maeve slowly stops levitating, her dress fluttering in the wind. 
Maeve: “I know you, Abel. You, however, are an unfamiliar face.”
Narrator: Maeve points to you.
Sora: “I’m Sora Belosa.”
Maeve: “Ah, Dr. Solis’ second [son].”
Narrator: Maeve pauses.
Maeve: “I take it you don’t know much of what is happening then?”
Sora: “Abel told me a little.”
Narrator: Maeve’s neutral face turns a little angry before turning back to a stony mask. 
Maeve: “Billie, guard the door. I need to have a private conversation with these two.”
Billie: “Got it.”
Narrator: Billie leaves.


Narrator: Maeve looks you both up and down with a critical eye. 
Maeve: “Abel, the letter instructed that you keep all delicate matters to yourself.”
Abel: “Sora was already here when I got here. This kind of situation is hard to explain away.” [No shake]
Abel: “If anything, you should be blaming Connor for bringing Sora here.” [No shake]
Narrator: Maeve sighs.
Maeve: “I suppose I’ll have to talk to him. (Again.)”
Narrator: Maeve turns to you.
Maeve: “I’ll fill you in on what’s going to happen. Before that can happen, however.”
Maeve: “I’ll need you to prove your worth to me.”
Narrator: Abel scoffs.
Maeve: “The only people allowed to stay within this facility must abide by certain rules.”
Maeve: “One of those rules is that you remain an asset to the team by being able to defend yourself.”
Maeve: “Are you prepared to show me that you can handle this condition?”
Choice: {“Of course!”} or {“Why should I?”}

Pre-Game - Intro [Post-Character Creation]

Sora Belosa/[Inserted Name] - 
It’s you!! Much better.

Abel Solis - 
Abel is your older twin brother. He’s downstairs talking to Mom right now about where he’ll be living now that Dad died and about his future plans. You heard in passing that he has an important business trip to attend, so you’ll be staying in your childhood home for about a week before going back home with Mom. You haven’t seen each other in 10 years. The two of you were separated by a custody battle of your parents divorce, and only met back up again for your father’s funeral. When he saw you, he cried. It’s weird seeing your own face cry. He missed you “a ton”, but never took the time to answer calls or letters. He’s still the same at the core. Clingy, absentminded, and pretty immature. You have missed him though.

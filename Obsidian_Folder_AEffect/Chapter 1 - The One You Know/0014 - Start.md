[Start of Game]

Narrator: You look at the glowing portal that has sat itself over your door. After a few seconds of looking, nothing happens. You reach out.
Narrator: You stick your hand into the middle of the portal, it also does nothing.
Narrator: You try to pull your hand back. It’s stuck. The portal shines brighter and begins to swirl more rapidly. 
Narrator: The pull of the portal is too much, you slide against the floor as it sucks in your arm. There’s no going back now.
SFX: Portal zwoop.
Sora: “Woah!”
Screen fades to black.


Screen fades back in. 
Narrator: The portal that had sucked you in now spits you out. You stumble forward, trying to catch yourself and knock right into another person.
??? [Billie]: “Oh!”
Narrator: The person sets you upright before walking to the door at the end of the room and shouting out of it.
??? [Billie]: “Our mystery guest is here!”
SFX: Muffled Dialogue
??? [Good]: “(Okay!)”
Narrator: The person walks back over to you.
??? [Billie]: “Hi, I’m Billie (my pronouns are it/its)” [Game Note: Text in parentheses, especially Billie’s and Abel’s mumbles, are meant to be smaller font size.] [Author’s Note: How do people naturally introduce pronouns into a narrative?]
Narrator: Billie looks nervous to tell you that last part, so it said its pronouns quietly. It continues on.
Billie: “You’re here to help the council, right?”
Narrator: You have no idea what it is talking about.
Billie: “They were so excited to hear back from you. (You took so long, they thought you weren’t going to respond.)”
Narrator: You are about to tell Billie that you have no idea what it's talking about, when the portal opens again. 

SFX: Portal zwoop
Narrator: You and Billie turn around in shock. 
??? [Abel]: “(Man, you’d think their mode of transportation would be less…violent)” [Game Note: No shaky text on Abel here.]
Narrator: The person that comes through the portal is wearing a hood so you can’t see their face clearly, but you’d know that voice and outfit anywhere. 
Sora: “Abel?”
Narrator: At the sound of his name, Abel looks up. 
Abel: “Sora? What are you doing here?” [Game Note: From here and onwards, unless specifically noted, Abel’s text should shake.]
Narrator: Billie cuts off your questionable reunion with your brother. 
Billie: “Why are there two of you?”
Choice: {Pull Abel behind you. “What do you mean? There’s only one of me.”} or {“I don’t get why you are the confused one here.”} or {Talk over Billie. “Abel, explain yourself.”}

[Author’s Note: Outside of story events, I would like for major characters to have 3-5 events per Chapter (Probably). If this gets to be too much then I can always cut it down.]
[Game Note for Menu Screen: I would like stats here with the summaries if we have them. I’m not sure if character favor should be listed in anything other than Hint Mode. I want the menu to be accessible almost all the time. Menu should also have a slot for items. Other characters shouldn’t be visible in the menu until they come into the story.]

CH 1 - The One You Know - Menu Character Summaries

Pre-Game - Intro [Pre-all choices]

Sora Belosa - 
It’s you. You want to get out of this suit, it’s depressing.

[Author’s Note for Sora: As the chapters go on, depending on how Sora acts, I would like the summary to change. (Ex.: It’s you!! VS It’s you?)]

Abel Solis - 
Abel is your older twin brother. He’s older than you by 5 minutes, he acts like it was 5 years. You haven’t seen each other in 10 years. The two of you were separated by a custody battle of your parents divorce, and only met back up again for your father’s funeral. He’s still the same at the core. 

Pre-Game - Intro [Post-Character Creation]

Sora Belosa/[Inserted Name] - 
It’s you!! Much better.

Abel Solis - 
Abel is your older twin brother. He’s downstairs talking to Mom right now about where he’ll be living now that Dad died and about his future plans. You heard in passing that he has an important business trip to attend, so you’ll be staying in your childhood home for about a week before going back home with Mom. You haven’t seen each other in 10 years. The two of you were separated by a custody battle of your parents divorce, and only met back up again for your father’s funeral. When he saw you, he cried. It’s weird seeing your own face cry. He missed you “a ton”, but never took the time to answer calls or letters. He’s still the same at the core. Clingy, absentminded, and pretty immature. You have missed him though.

Abel Solis, Page 2 - 
You don’t want to know this.
When you woke up, Abel’s severed head sat at the foot of your bed. The blood soaked through your covers, pajamas, and socks. You are stained in a way that cannot be cleaned. The body was nowhere to be found. They aren’t sure what kind of weapon could’ve done this. The detective said that the cut went clean through his neck and spine, so if his death hurt, then it wasn’t for long. You can’t get his expression out of your mind, he looked so scared.

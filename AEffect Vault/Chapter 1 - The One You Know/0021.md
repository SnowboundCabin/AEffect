Narrator: You get it, as much as you can get anyways.
Sora: “I’ll go home, but you have to stay safe!”
Sora: “We just found each other again, don’t leave me alone again so soon. Alright?”
Narrator: Abel’s grin is bright and teary. 
Abel: “I got it.”
Abel: “Thank you.”
Narrator: Abel gives you a tight hug, squeezing you until it gets a little uncomfortable. 
Narrator: When he pulls back, his face is more serious than you’ve ever seen it. 
Abel: “Billie, can you help me get Sora home?”
Billie: “Sure thing! Let me go grab Connor.”

Narrator: You and Abel sit on the floor and talk until Billie comes back with a tall person with blue hair. 
Narrator: You assume this is Connor.
Narrator: The new person waves their hands around for a bit before a small vortex materializes between their palms. 
Narrator: The vortex stretches out until it’s about the size of a door. 
Narrator: You wave goodbye to Abel and let the portal’s gravity take you home. 
~ Time Skip ~
Narrator: True to his word, Abel comes home. It takes a handful of months, but your brother is back with you. Your family is whole again.
